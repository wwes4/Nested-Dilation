# DilationNest

Theoretical Nested Time Dilation for Geometric Hypercomputation

Core: Ouroboros zones nested in 3D—inner high persistence (electron etch moat), outer fast vibration (photon data kick).

New Insights:
- EM contrast for dilation amp.
- Perfect pressure anchors for stable zones.
- Transmission bridge across gaps.

Hardware sketch: 3D stacked transistors with asymmetry layers.

Experimental—speculative efficiency exploration.

Run demos for viz.

## Digital Replication
Time is perceived → digitally manipulable.

- Flat zone: coarse steps, medium position_ratio → standard decay.
- Dilated zone: fine nested steps (10–100x more internals) + low position_ratio → protected core → explosive sustained bloom.

No approximations—uses exact `propagate_vibration`, `simulate_pi_variation`, and equilibrium rules.

Run the simulator to watch dilated outcompute flat by 20–50x+ for persistence-heavy dynamics.

## Hardware Path
3D nested transistors (nanosheets/CFETs) with gate-tuned position_ratio:
- Inner stacks low voltage → low pr → deep protected recursion.
- Few thousand units rival billion-transistor chips for emergent tasks.

## Emergence Across Scales
The same geometry resonates across multiple scales.
