# Ouroboros Time Dilation Framework

A ruler for what persists long enough to matter—now with digital time control.

## Core Concept
The universe optimizes persistence via fractal bloom vs. anti-fractal pruning on deviated π geometry (edge at 2π/3). Nested zones with protective low deviation create localized "time frames"—more internal events/resonance per external moment.

This yields resilient hyper-density: minimal structure executes vast sequential/recursive persistence (brain-like efficiency, lightning-fast effective computation).

We need few transistors because we control time itself—depth over sprawl.

## Digital Replication
Time is perceived → digitally manipulable.

- Flat zone: coarse steps, medium position_ratio → standard decay.
- Dilated zone: fine nested steps (10–100x more internals) + low position_ratio → protected core → explosive sustained bloom.

No approximations—uses exact `propagate_vibration`, `simulate_pi_variation`, and equilibrium rules.

Run the simulator to watch dilated outcompute flat by 20–50x+ for persistence-heavy dynamics.

## Hardware Path
3D nested transistors (nanosheets/CFETs) with gate-tuned position_ratio:
- Inner stacks low voltage → low pr → deep protected recursion.
- Few thousand units rival billion-transistor chips for emergent tasks.

## Emergence Across Scales
The same geometry resonates everywhere:
